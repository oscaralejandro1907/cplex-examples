## model-1
A simple example, made without classes, and inside the ```main``` function. The model has 3 variables of 1 subindex (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>). After model is solved solution status, solution value (obj. function), values of variables, and slacks of constraints are printed.

## feed-mix
An example of a feed-mix problem. This example is in the book: Bazaraa. Linear Programming and Network Flows. 4th Ed. Chapter 1 Exercise 1.3 page 29-30.

## integer-model-pcol
An example of an integer model with two types of variables of 1 subindex (x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub>). This model is populated by columns.

## graph-coloring
An introduction example to Constraint Programming (CP). An instance about a problem of graph coloring is solved with this solution method.

## flow-shop-cp
A CP model for a classic Flow-shop Scheduling Problem. Instance data format is provided in the examples of the cplex local installation folder.
