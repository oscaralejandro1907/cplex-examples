## model-1
A simple example, made without classes, and inside the ```main``` function. The model has 3 variables of 1 subindex (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>). After model is solved solution status, solution value (obj. function), values of variables, and slacks of constraints are printed.

## feed-mix
An example of a feed-mix problem. This example is in the book: Bazaraa. Linear Programming and Network Flows. 4th Ed. Chapter 1 Exercise 1.3 page 29-30.

## integer-model-pcol
An example of an integer model with two types of variables of 1 subindex (x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub>). This model is populated by columns.
